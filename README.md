**<a name="about"></a>About the Project**

This is a digital platform for sharing books in an organization. The project is created using flutter framework and firebase services. Google authentication is used for validation of an account. There is also a recommendation system for a particular subject. If student is not aware of subject then this system is useful for him/her. A form is created for adding new book. We can search a book by it&#39;s name from home page.
